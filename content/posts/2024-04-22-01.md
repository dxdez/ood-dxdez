### VPN Open Connect

To connect to a VPN endpoint from the Linux terminal using your username and password, you can follow these steps. First, install the OpenConnect VPN client on your Linux machine:
```
sudo apt-get install openconnect
```

Then, use the openconnect command to initiate the VPN connection, providing the VPN endpoint URL and your username:
```
sudo openconnect connect.whatever.com --user=YOUR_USERNAME
```

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username for the VPN.
